# Document-Tagging
Multilabel classification is a type of classification task where each instance (e.g., a document, an image, or a sample) can belong to multiple classes simultaneously. In other words, instead of assigning just one label or class to each instance, multilabel classification assigns multiple labels or classes, allowing for more nuanced and complex predictions. 

In this git, we are trying to tags the document based on its content into several tags. The document is the abstract of ArXiv preprint and the tag is the topic related to the document such as Machine learning, Artificial Intelligence, etc.

## Dataset
Dataset used in this git is from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spsayakpaul/arxiv-paper-abstracts?select=arxiv_data_210930-054931.csv) dataset contains the title, the abstract, and the tag of the document

## Use Case
Multilabel classification can be used for diverse applicaton such as tagging news automatically, tagging document automatically, and not limited into document also can be applied into images such as image recognition, videos such as videos taging and sound to recognize the genre of the music.
